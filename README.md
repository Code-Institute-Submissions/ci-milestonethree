## UX

This is Milestone Three Project in Data Centric Development Module of the Full Stack Web Development by Code Institute.

As a qualified Pastry Chef, I found this project had a great meaning and purpose for me. I decided that I wanted to create
an app that could store recipes for me. Not only me that anyone interested could register and upload recipes, view and
try others. 

### User Stories

As a User to this app, I want to be able to do the following.

    * Gain access to an app to store my recipes
    * Upload recipes that I have used and would like to save/share
    * Be able to edit the recipes if a better method was found or similar
    * Be able to delete the recipe if it wasnt good
    * Have a database of recipes that could be searched for new ideas etc
    * Be able to view/search different categories of recipes
    * Have the ability to Login as a user and safely Logout

### Design

#### Framework

* **[Materialize 1.0.0](https://materializecss.com/)**

I used Materialize Framework for the layout and components, I prefer this Framework to the Bootstrap Framework althought
very similar in layout

* **[Flask 1.0.2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)**

I used Flask the micro web application Framework that actually runs the application

* **[jQuery 3.4.0](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/)**

jQuery is a JavaScript library which I used to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation in my collapsible
popout, modal, icon rotate and buttons etc

#### Database

I used MongoDB for the database, This was used throughout the course material. MongoDB is a NoSQL database and was
perfect for my project. I found it very difficult to understand sometimes but with a little help from Slack and Guido
I  was able to improve my understanding. I still feel I could use some more learning and I have every intention to do 
so at a later stage.

I built up my collections in MongoDB and have listed them below
